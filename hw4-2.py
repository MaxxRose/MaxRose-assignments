# PART 1: Lists

# EXERCISE 1: Guest List

# EXERCISE 1a: If you could invite anyone, living or deceased, to dinner, who would you invite? 
# Make a list that includes at least three people you’d like to invite to dinner. 
# Then use your list to print a message to each person, inviting them to dinner.

# EXERCISE 1b: You just heard that one of your guests can’t make the dinner, so you need to send out a new set of invitations. You’ll have to think of someone else to invite. 
# Start with your program from Exercise 1a. 
# Add a print() call at the end of your program stating the name of the guest who can’t make it. 
# Modify your list, replacing the name of the guest who can’t make it with the name of the new person you are inviting. 
# Print a second set of invitation messages, one for each person who is still in your list.

# EXERCISE 1c: You just found a bigger dinner table, so now more space is available. Think of three more guests to invite to dinner. 
# Start with your program from Exercise 1a or Exercise 1b. 
# Add a print() call to the end of your program informing people that you found a bigger dinner table. 
# Use insert() to add one new guest to the beginning of your list. 
# Use insert() to add one new guest to the middle of your list. 
# Use append() to add one new guest to the end of your list. 
# Print a new set of invitation messages, one for each person in your list.

# EXERCISE 1d: You just found out that your new dinner table won’t arrive in time for the dinner, and you have space for only two guests. 
# Start with your program from Exercise 1c. 
# Add a new line that prints a message saying that you can invite only two people for dinner. 
# Use pop() to remove guests from your list one at a time until only two names remain in your list. Each time you pop a name from your list, print a message to that person letting them know you’re sorry you can’t invite them to dinner. 
# Print a message to each of the two people still on your list, letting them know they’re still invited. 
# Use del() to remove the last two names from your list, so you have an empty list. 
# Print your list to make sure you actually have an empty list at the end of your program.

# EXERCISE 1e: Working with one of the programs from Exercises 1a through d, use len() to print a message indicating the number of people you are inviting to dinner.

# EXERCISE 2: Think of at least five places in the world you’d like to visit. 
# Store the locations in a list. Make sure the list is not in alphabetical order. 
# Print your list in its original order. Use sorted() to print your list in alphabetical order without modifying the actual list. 
# Show that your list is still in its original order by printing it. 
# Use sorted() to print your list in reverse alphabetical order without changing the order of the original list. 
# Show that your list is still in its original order by printing it again. 
# Use reverse() to change the order of your list. 
# Print the list to show that its order has changed. 
# Use reverse() to change the order of your list again. 
# Print the list to show it’s back to its original order. 
# Use sort() to change your list so it’s stored in alphabetical order. 
# Print the list to show that its order has been changed. 
# Use sort() to change your list so it’s stored in reverse alphabetical order. 
# Print the list to show that its order has changed.

# EXERCISE 3: One Million 
# Make a list of the numbers from one to one million, and then use a for loop to print the numbers. (If the output is taking too long, stop it by pressing CTRL-C or by closing the output window.)
# Make a list of the numbers from one to one million, and then use min() and max() to make sure your list actually starts at one and ends at one million. 
# Also, use the sum() function to see how quickly Python can add a million numbers.

# EXERCISE 4: Odd Numbers
# Use the third argument of the range() function to make a list of the odd numbers from 1 to 20. 
# Use a for loop to print each number.

# PART 2: Dictionaries

# EXERCISE 1: Person

# EXERCISE 1a: Use a dictionary to store information about a person you know. 
# Store their first name, last name, age, and the city in which they live. You should have keys such as first_name, last_name, age, and city. 
# Print each piece of information stored in your dictionary.

# EXERCISE 1b: People
# Make two new dictionaries representing different people, and store all three dictionaries in a list called people. 
# Loop through your list of people. As you loop through the list, print everything you know about each person.

# EXERCISE 2: Favorite Number

# EXERCISE 2a: Use a dictionary to store people’s favorite numbers. 
# Think of five names, and use them as keys in your dictionary. 
# Think of a favorite number for each person, and store each as a value in your dictionary. 
# Print each person’s name and their favorite number. 

# EXERCISE 2b: Favorite Numbers
# Modify your program from Exercise 2a so each person can have more than one favorite number. 
# Then print each person’s name along with their favorite numbers.

# EXERCISE 3: Glossary

# EXERCISE 3a: A Python dictionary can be used to model an actual dictionary. However, to avoid confusion, let’s call it a glossary. Think of five programming words you’ve learned about in the previous chapters. 
# Use these words as the keys in your glossary, and store their meanings as values.
# Print each word and its meaning as neatly formatted output. You might print the word followed by a colon and then its meaning, or print the word on one line and then print its meaning indented on a second line. 
# Use the newline character (\n) to insert a blank line between each word-meaning pair in your output.

# EXERCISE 3b: Looping
# Now that you know how to loop through a dictionary, clean up the code from Exercise 6-3 (page 99) by replacing your series of print() calls with a loop that runs through the dictionary’s keys and values. 
# When you’re sure that your loop works, add five more Python terms to your glossary. 
# When you run your program again, these new words and meanings should automatically be included in the output.

# EXERCISE 4: Pets
# Make several dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a different pet. 
# In each dictionary, include the kind of animal and the owner’s name. 
# Store these dictionaries in a list called pets. 
# Next, loop through your list and as you do, print everything you know about each pet.

# EXERCISE 5: Cities
# Make a dictionary called cities. 
# Use the names of three cities as keys in your dictionary. 
# Create a dictionary of information about each city and include the country that the city is in, its approximate population, and one fact about that city. The keys for each city’s dictionary should be something like country, population, and fact.
# Print the name of each city and all of the information you have stored about it.
