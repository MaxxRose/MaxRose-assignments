# EXERICSE 1
# Write a function called display_message() that prints one sentence telling everyone
# what you are learning about in class. Call the function, and make sure the message
# displays correctly.
function="display_message(ur mom)"
# EXERCISE 2A
# Make a list containing a series of short text messages. Pass the list to a function
# called show_messages(), which prints each text message.

thislist = ["ur mom", "banana", "Cut my life into peices, this is my last resort"]
pass ;thislist (show messages)
    print=show_messages


# EXERCISE 2B
# Start with a copy of your program from Exercise 2A. Write a function called
# send_messages() that prints each text message and moves each message to a new list
# called sent_messages as it’s printed. After calling the function, print both of your
# lists to make sure the messages were moved correctly.
thislist = ["ur mom", "banana", "Cut my life into peices, this is my last resort"]
pass ;thislist (show messages)
    print=show_messages


# EXERCISE 2C
# Start with your work from Exercise 2B. Call the function send_messages() with a copy
# of the list of messages. After calling the function, print both of your lists to show
# that the original list has retained its messages.

# EXERCISE 3
# Using a program you wrote that has one function in it, store that function in a
# separate file. Import the function into your main program file, and call the function
# using each of these approaches:
# import module_name
# from module_name import function_name
# from module_name import function_name as fn
# import module_name as mn
# from module_name import *

# EXERCISE 4
# You can find data files containing information about the most recent earthquakes over
# 1-hour, 1-day, 7-day, and 30-day periods online. Go to
# https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php and you’ll see a list of links
# to data sets for various time periods, focusing on earthquakes of different magnitudes.
# Download one of these data sets, and create a visualization of the most recent earthquake
# activity.
